# book-search-engine

## Description

Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

### Motivation

As an avid reader I want to search for new books to read
so I can keep a list of books to purchase

### Why?

The ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

### Problem Solved

When I'm logged in I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account

### Learnings

How to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API and I learned how to Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
